## Description

This repository hosts the source code for a comprehensive capstone project called "Forum Clone." The project aims to replicate the functionality of an online forum, including a server, client, and mobile application components.

The primary goal of this project is to create a fully functional forum system with a variety of features, allowing users to engage in discussions, share information, and interact with one another in a familiar online forum environment.

## Components

### 1. Server

The server component of the project is responsible for handling the core backend logic of the forum system. It manages user authentication, database interactions, content creation, and other essential operations. This server will likely be implemented using a web framework or technology stack suitable for building a robust backend.

### 2. Client

The client component represents the frontend of the forum system. It serves as the user interface for interacting with the forum. Users will access this component via their web browsers, where they can view and interact with forum content, create new threads, reply to existing discussions, and perform other user-related actions.

### 3. Mobile

The mobile component provides a mobile application for users who prefer to access the forum on their smartphones or tablets. It will offer a responsive and user-friendly interface designed specifically for mobile devices. Users can engage in discussions, access their profiles, and use forum features while on the go.

## Features

The "Forum Clone" project is expected to include various features commonly found in online forum systems:

- User Registration and Authentication
- Forum Categories and Subcategories
- Thread Creation and Management
- Commenting on Threads
- User Profiles
- Notifications
- Search Functionality
- Moderation and Admin Features
- Responsive Design for Mobile Devices
